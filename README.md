## Description

Local elected officials have a significant impact on our day-to-day lives. About 33% of state-level legislators run unopposed. Thatâ€™s a problem if you believe in democracy. With Run For This, you can enter an address and see what local offices are opening up nearby and how to run for those seats.

`bundle install`
